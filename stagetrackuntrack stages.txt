three stages of files--------------
In Git, files go through different stages in the workflow: untracked, staged, and tracked (committed).

untracked--all files are untracked in filesystem.These files exist in your working directory but are not yet tracked by Git.(RED COLOUR)
git add <filename>
git add . (to stage all files)

staged--Files that are added to the staging area but not yet committed.These files are ready to be committed in the next commit.(GREEN COLOUR)Either you can untrack or track.
git rm --cached <file>..." to untrack it again
git commit -m "added testing files"   to track it


tracked--all files are tracked in git VCS.Files that are already committed to the Git repository.Git is now tracking changes for these files.
